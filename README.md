# The Tale of a Boundary-Layer Problem

__Abstract:__ I will demonstrate the solution with all its steps (and missteps) to the boundary layer problem $\varepsilon y'' = yy' - y$, such that $y(0) = 1$ and $y(1) = -1$ and where $\varepsilon \ll 1$. The journey towards the solution will take us on an excurse through some basics of _perturbation theory_ and _asymptotic approximation matching_. I will demonstrate visualizations that will give you insight into the reasoning behind the steps taken towards the solution serving as an exhibition for the leverage in problem solving accessible to us through the computational power at our fingertips.
